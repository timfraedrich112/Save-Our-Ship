# Save-Our-Ship

This game is a VR escape room. The player needs to search the environment for clues in order to solve puzzles and save the ship before time runs out!

- The goal of this project was to create an immersive experience for the player that utilizes the functionalities of virtual reality
- Created for and tested with an Oculus Quest 2
- This project was completed for my XR Game Development course final at the University of New Haven
